Use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. If you will NOT be using R, download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data. If you are planning on using Posit’s RStudio, use the Divvy 2019 Q1 and Divvy 2020 Q1 datasets. Choosing other data might lead to errors because the data exceeds the memory available in the free plan. (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.) This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple
single passes.
